#  IMPORTANT NOTE: All time values must be specified in STANDARD time,  #
#                  i.e. MEZ!  If DCF77 time is MESZ (daylight saving    #
#                  time), they will automatically converted to MESZ.    #
#                                                                       #

# Configuration Variables in config.txt:

# SENSOR1_TYPE [VCNL, HT, CO2, C]
#   - VCNL is  Fully Integrated Proximity and
#     Ambient Light Sensor with Infrared Emitter,
#   - HT is Humidity and Temperature Sensor, 
#   - CO2 is C02, humidity and temperature sensor 
#   - C is Event Recorder tells the User that events occurred (Counter)
#   POWER_SENSOR1 is always VDD_SENSOR1


# SENSOR2_TYPE [VCNL, HT, CO2, C]
#   - VCNL is  Fully Integrated Proximity and
#     Ambient Light Sensor with Infrared Emitter,
#   - HT is Humidity and Temperature Sensor, 
#   - CO2 is C02, humidity and temperature sensor 
#   - C is Event Recorder tells the User that events occurred (Counter)
#   POWER_SENSOR2 is always VDD_SENSOR2

# SENSOR1_ON_TIME_1~5, SENSOR1_OFF_TIME_1~5, SENSOR2_ON_TIME_1~5, SENSOR2_OFF_TIME_1~5,
#   These variables determine the on and off times of the SENSOR1,
#   respective SENSOR2 power output.  

# SENSOR1_INTERVAL, SENSOR1_ON_DURATION, SENSOR2_INTERVAL, SENSOR2_ON_DURATION in [s]
#   These optional variables allow you to define a Power Cycle Interval within
#   the on times of the respective power output.  XXX_INTERVAL specifies the
#   interval in seconds, XXX_ON_DURATION the power ON duration in seconds
#   within this interval.
#   The OFF duration is calculated XXX_INTERVAL minus XXX_ON_DURATION.
#   There exists only one set of values per output.  These are applicable for
#   all five on/off-times.
#   POWER_SENSOR1 is always VDD_SENSOR1
#   POWER_SENSOR2 is always VDD_SENSOR2

# TIME [HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND]
#   The Logger time without radio clock receiver(dcf77) is much too inaccurate.
#   At least the error will be 10 minutes per year and there will be no detection for MEZ/MESZ.
#   But Software and Hardware is available to support dcf 77 radio clock receiver. 
#   It makes no sense to set Seconds via the config.txt file and
#   Milliseconds are calculated from the microcontroller.     
#   The default time given from the microcontroller after repower will be always
#   xxxxxxxx-120000.000  xxxxxxxx-hhmmss.msmsms
#   Set [HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND] to [00] to skip changes!! 

# DATE [DAY, MONTH, YEAR]
#   The default date given from the microcontroller after repower will be always
#   20140101-xxxxxx.xxx  YYYYMMDD-xxxxxx.xxx
#   Set [YEAR, MONTH, DAY] to [00] to skip changes
